In this project, I have worked on COVID-19 Dataset. Using matplotlib and seaborn plots, I was able to plot various graphs such as line plot, pointplot etc. From this plot, one can generate useful insights for a particular State/Ut. Also, comparison between 3 countries were done (India, Italy, South Korea), Once this ML part was done, all the graphs and plots were displayed on a web page using HTML and CSS. Link for the same can be found below.
